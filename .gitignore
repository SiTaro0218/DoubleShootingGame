# Autogenerated VS/Rider files
# These files are generated by Unity, but also by VS/Rider.
# Exclude them to prevent unnecessary noise in the repository.
# For example, if you open a project in Unity, then open in VS, then close VS and open again, these files are regenerated.
# If they are included in git, they will be marked as modified (even if no real changes).
# To avoid this, it's safer to exclude them.
# Instead, let Unity generate them on project open.
# The downside is that they will not be available until Unity is open.
# The other solution is to commit them and just ignore the "modified" status.

# Optional: Exclude .vscode/ to prevent committing user-specific VS Code settings.
# If you want to share workspace settings (e.g., extensions.json), consider creating a .vscode/settings.json.
